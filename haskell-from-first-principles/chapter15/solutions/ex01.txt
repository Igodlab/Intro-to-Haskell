Like other scripts that import datatypes and instances from another file, we need to compile it locally. Go to the directory where `MaybeAnotherMonoid_pg934.hs` is and then 

```
$ ghc -I. --make MaybeAnotherMonoid.hs
```

Given a datatype, implement the Semigroup instance. Add Semigroup constraints to type variables where needed. Use the Semigroup class from the semigroups library (or from base if you are on GHC 8) or write your own. When we use (<>), we mean the infix mappend from the Semigroup typeclass. 

Note We’re not always going to derive every instance you may want or need in the datatypes we provide for exercises. We expect you to know what you need and to take care of it yourself by this point.

 Given a datatype, implement the Monoid instance. Add Monoid constraints to type variables where needed. For the datatypes you’ve already implemented Semigroup instances for, you need to figure out what the identity value is.

Again, validate all of your instances with QuickCheck. Example scaﬀold is provided for the Trivial type.
