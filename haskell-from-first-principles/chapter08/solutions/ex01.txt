Given the following definitions, tell us what value results from further applications.

cattyConny :: String -> String -> String
cattyConny x y = x ++ " mrow " ++ y

-- fill in the types
--
flippy = flip cattyConny
appedCatty = cattyConny "woops"
frappe = flippy "haha"
--


1. What is the value of appedCatty "woohoo!" ? Try to determine the answer for yourself, then test in the REPL.
# Ans: "woops mrow woohoo!"

2. 
frappe "1"
# Ans: "1 mrow haha"

3. 
frappe (appedCatty "2")
# Ans: "woops mrow 2"

4. 
appedCatty (frappe "blue")
# Ans: "blue mrow haha"

5. 
cattyConny (frappe "pink")
           (cattyConny "green" (appedCatty "blue"))
