module CasePractice where

-- First, rewrite if-then-else expressions into case expressions. 
-- 1. The following should return x when x is greater than y.
functionC  x y = if x > y then x else y
functionC' x y = case x > y of
                    True  -> x
                    False -> y

-- 2. The following will add 2 to even numbers and otherwise simply return the input value.
ifEvenAdd2  n = if even n then n + 2 else n
ifEvenAdd2' n = case even n of
                    True  -> n + 2
                    False -> n

-- The next exercise doesnâ€™t have all the cases covered. See if you can fix it.
-- 3. The following compares a value, x, to zero and returns an indicator for whether x is a postive number or negative number. But what if x is 0? You may need to play with the compare function a bit to find what to do.
nums x =
    case compare x 0 of
        LT -> -1
        GT -> 1
        EQ -> 0
