 -- Use the Maybe type to write a function that counts the number of vowels in a string and the number of consonants. If the number of vowels exceeds the number of consonants, the function returns Nothing. In many human languages, vowels rarely exceed the number of consonants so when they do, it may indicate the input isnâ€™t a word (that is, a valid input to your dataset):
