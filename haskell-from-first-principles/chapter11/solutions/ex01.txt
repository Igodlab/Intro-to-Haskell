       λ> :t (Mastiff "Scooby Doo")
       (Mastiff "Scooby Doo) :: Doggies [Char]

#           Cardinality
# 
#

While we haven’t explicitly described the rules for calculating the cardinality of datatypes yet, you might already have an idea of how to do it for simple datatypes with nullary constructors. Try not to overthink these exercises — follow your intuition based on what you know.


1. data PugType = PugData
# Ans: Cardinality is zero (nullary)

2. For this one, recall that Bool is also defined with the |:

data Airline =
      PapuAir
    | CatapultsR'Us
    | TakeYourChancesUnited

# Ans: Cardinality is 3

3. Given what we know about Int8, what’s the cardinality of Int16?
# Ans: Cardinality is 2^16=65536

4. Use the REPL and maxBound and minBound to examine Int and Integer. What can you say about the cardinality of those types? 
# Ans: λ> maxBound :: Int
#      9223372036854775807
#
#      λ> minBound :: Int
#      -9223372036854775808
#
#      whereas there is no instance for Bounded Integer, as it can represent as infinetly large numbers

        

5. Extra credit (impress your friends!): What’s the connection between the 8 in Int8 and that type’s cardinality of 256?
# Ans: Int8 type can represent 2^8 = 256 values 



##################################
# page 618: Exercises
#           For Example
# 
#

Given:

data Example = MakeExample deriving Show

1. You can query the type of a value in GHCi with the :type command, also abbreviated :t.
Example:

Prelude> :t False
False :: Bool

What is the type of data constructor MakeExample? What happens when you request the type of Example? 
# Ans: Example
       
       λ> :t Example
       error: Data constructor not in scope: Example

2. What if you try :info on Example in GHCi? Can you determine what typeclass instances are defined for the Example type using :info in GHCi?
# Ans: We'll get info about its definition and instances
      
       λ> :i Example
       data Example = MakeExample

       instance [safe] Show Example 
       

3. Try making a new datatype like Example but with a single type argument added to MakeExample, such as Int. What has changed when you query MakeExample with :type in GHCi?
# Ans: λ> data ExampleX = MakeExampleX Int deriving Show
       
       λ> :t MakeExampleX
       MakeExampleX :: Int -> ExampleX

       MakeExampleX has the type signature similar to a function that takes a type (Int) instead of values and returns a type ExampleX

#           The Quad
# 
#

Determine how many unique inhabitants each type has. Suggestion: do the arithmetic unless you want to verify. Writing them out gets tedious quickly. 
eg. a -> b -> c
    = (c ^ b) ^ a
    = c ^ (b * a)  -- equivalent, given arithmetic laws.


1. data Quad = One | Two | Three | Four deriving (Eq, Show)
-- how many different forms can this take?

eQuad :: Either Quad Quad
eQuad = ???
# Ans: eQuad = 4 * 4 = 16

2. prodQuad :: (Quad, Quad)
# Ans: prodQuad = 4 * 4 = 16

3. funcQuad :: Quad -> Quad
# Ans: funcQuad = 4 ^ 4 = 256

4. prodTBool :: (Bool, Bool, Bool)
# Ans: prodTBool = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8

5. gTwo :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
# Ans: gTwo = 2 ^ (2 ^ 2) = 16

6. Hint: 5 digit number
fTwo :: Bool -> Quad -> Quad
# Ans: fTwo = 4 ^ (4 * 2) = 65536

#           Multiple Choice
# 
#

1. Given the following datatype:
data Weekday = Monday
             | Tuesday
             | Wednesday
             | Thursday
             | Friday

we can say:
a) Weekday is a type with five data constructors
b) Weekday is a tree with five branches
c) Weekday is a product type
d) Weekday takes five arguments


2. and with the same datatype definition in mind, what is the type of the following function, f? 

f Friday = "Miller Time"

a) f :: [Char]
b) f :: String -> String
c) f :: Weekday -> String
d) f :: Day -> Beer


3. Types defined with the data keyword

a) must have at least one argument
b) must begin with a capital letter
c) must be polymorphic
d) cannot be imported from modules


4. The function g xs = xs !! (length xs - 1)

a) is recursive and may not terminate
b) delivers the head of xs
c) delivers the final element of xs
d) has the same type as xs
